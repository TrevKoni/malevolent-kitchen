        <h3 class="about-2">About Us:</h3>
        <p class="about-us">
          Malevolent Kitchen is a project by two computer science students. As part of our studies, <br>
          we created this website to showcase our coding skills. While we're not professional chefs, <br>
          we love desserts and wanted to share our passion with others. Thanks for visiting and <br>
          supporting our project!
